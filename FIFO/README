This is a simple FIFO implemented as a single linked queue.
It is coupled with google test.



This project is equipped with 2 build methods
' .vscode configuration files
'' uncomment the main() in the queue.cpp
'' ctrl+shif+B, to compile the project, but without the google test

' use cmake to compile both the project and google tests
'' make sure main() in queue.cpp is commented
'' mkdir build && cd build
'' cmake ..
'' make
'' run the exeuctable: test/googleTestTutorial_tests
